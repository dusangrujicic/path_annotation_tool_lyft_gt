1) useful function in https://github.com/nutonomy/nuscenes-devkit/blob/master/python-sdk/nuscenes/map_expansion/utils.py
    - get_egoposes_on_drivable_ratio



Data extraction:
1) For every scene - get all sample tokens
2) For every sample token - extract the sample data:
    Most importatnly egopositions from the future samples up to the end of the scene
3) Then the extracted data for every frame includes the standard data plus the egopositions
from subsequent frames normalized for the current frame (so in local 2D top down coordinates 
of the current frame)
4) Display that in the tool
